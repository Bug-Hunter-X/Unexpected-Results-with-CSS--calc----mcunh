The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if the calculation is too complex. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10%);` may not. The browser may not be able to handle calculations that involve percentages and pixels at the same time or that involve too many operands.
